# Frontend Repository for Recipe-Scaler

I built this project because I wanted to be able to scale recipes quickly rather than performing calculations on each and every single ingredient, especially for dishes with many ingredients. My goal for this project was to be able to allow me and other people who use this app to be able to scale recipes quickly and easily, and just be able to focus on cooking, rather than doing math.

## Tools Used

This was a very simple Next.js project, so very minimal technologies were used in the making of the frontend. I lightly used Material UI's CSS framework, but I ended up styling most of the project with vanilla CSS. I also used framer-motion for animations and small npm packages to help with url validation and other small things. I also was really interested in using a catppuccin theme for this project, so I used their mocha color palette for the project.

## BACKEND REPO

Most of my work was actually done [here](https://github.com/apolyeti/recipe-app), this was my first time writing backend in Golang let alone coding a single line of code in Golang, so it was definitely a learning experience for me.
